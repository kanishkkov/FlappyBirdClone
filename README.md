Clone of FlappyBird

Flappy Bird is a game that involves the player competing with himself to get the highest score! The objective of the game is to get the bird (ball) to fit in between the pipes to stay alive. Scoring is timer based with 1 second = 1 point. The ball is controlled by the user tapping the screen to move the ball up and letting go to move the ball down. If the ball hits a pipe, the top, or the bottom, then game over :(.  Whatâ€™s the highest score you can get?
